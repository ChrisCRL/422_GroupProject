Project Details

1. Whether the motivation of the project is well described.
2. Whether computational challenges are well described.
3. Whether the dataset is well described.
4. Whether choice of machine learning techniques is well justified.
5. Whether an appropriate approach is applied to realistic data sets that may be being used
in practice.
6. How well the experimental settings are described (especially for graduate students)

  b. What are evaluation strategies (e.g., k-fold cross validation) for the performance comparison?
  c. How many times are the experiments repeated?
7. How well the experimental results are discussed.
  a. How can the experimental results be interpreted?
8. Conclusion
9. Misc.
  a. What obstacles have you overcome?
